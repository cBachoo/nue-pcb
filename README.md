# Nue PCB rev1.1-***B***

![Nue-B PCB](https://imgur.com/G3tXXFl.png)

This is the open source PCB modified from the [Nue PCB](https://github.com/studiokestra/nue-pcb) for the Ouro Keyboard. This PCB was designed by kbye/studio kestra. 

It's minimally designed (as intentioned) with ISO support and basic 60% layout options. The Nue/Ouro PCB has gasket mounting tabs and as such will not work on any other keyboard. Fuse / ESD protection was not implemented initially as this was taken care of by the unifed C3 daughterboard, however future revisions will have it onboard as backup. These files are provided as-is and are intended for tinkerers, do not expect warranty or support to be provided.

## Features
