# Nue PCB rev1.1

![Nue PCB](https://i.imgur.com/nhXbPTc.png)

This is the open source PCB for the Nue keyboard. It's minimally designed (as intentioned) with ISO support and basic 60% layout options. The Nue PCB has gasket mounting tabs and as such will not work on any other keyboard. Fuse / ESD protection was not implemented initially as this was taken care of by the unifed C3 daughterboard, however future revisions will have it onboard as backup. These files are provided as-is and are intended for tinkerers, do not expect warranty or support to be provided.
